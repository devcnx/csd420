## 🛠️ JavaFX Development Tools

This repository includes an example script to simplify JavaFX development and execution:

**`run_javafx_example.sh`** - Example script to compile and run any JavaFX application

To use this script:
1. Copy `run_javafx_example.sh` to `run_javafx.sh`
2. Update the `JAVAFX_PATH` variable in `run_javafx.sh` to point to your JavaFX SDK installation
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x run_javafx.sh`

Usage:
```bash
./run_javafx.sh path/to/YourJavaFXApp.java
```

This script automatically handles:
- Setting the correct JavaFX module path
- Adding required JavaFX modules (javafx.controls, javafx.fxml)
- Enabling native access to avoid warnings
- Compiling and running the application

For applications requiring additional JavaFX modules (e.g., javafx.media), specify them as a second parameter:
```bash
./run_javafx.sh path/to/YourJavaFXApp.java javafx.media
```
